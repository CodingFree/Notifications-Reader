# Notifications-Reader
Notifications Reader for Firefox OS

## What it does
After installing this add-on, and rebooting your phone, all notifications that you receive will also be read to you as they arrive. 

Things to note and expect:
* Text to speach is not supported for all languages.
* "Notifications" are all items displayed in the "notifications" area. (That is the area which is displayed when you swipe down from the top of the screen.)

If your experience differs, please check the [open issues](https://github.com/CodingFree/Notifications-Reader/issues) and file a new one if missing.

# TODO
I should prevent multiple injections. Someday.
